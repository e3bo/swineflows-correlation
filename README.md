======================

To run the R analysis script within a Docker container with the
necessary software environment, simply execute the run-docker script
on a system with docker installed. The analysis output will be placed
in a time-stamped subdirectory of ./root that begins with "work". An
example of expected output is inside the archive
./root/work-example.tar.gz.
